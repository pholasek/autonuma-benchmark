Couple of scripts for automated benchmarking by numa01 and numa02 programs.
Requires: numactl-devel, run as root
Recommended: gnuplot (for visualizations)

Run ./start_bench -h for help or ./start_bench -A for all available tests.

./start_bench.sh [-stnbiA] [-h]
	-s : run numa02_SMT test additionally
	-t : run numa01_THREAD_ALLOC test additionally
	-b : run *_HARD_BIND tests additionally
	-i : run *_INVERSE_BIND tests additionally
	-A : run all available tests
	-h : this help

NOTE: -b/-i are mostly hardware dependent measurements, so they can be skipped
if the objective is to compare different automatic NUMA migration solutions.

P=# of processes, T=# of threads per process, M=memory per process

numa01
M=3GiB P=2, T=nr_cpus/2, all threads share all process memory

numa01_THREAD_ALLOC
M=3GiB, P=2, T=nr_cpus/2, all threads use per-thread local memory

numa02
M=1GiB, P=1, T=nr_cpus, all threads use per-thread local memory

numa02_SMT
M=1GiB, P=1, T=nr_cpus/2, all threads use per-thread local memory
